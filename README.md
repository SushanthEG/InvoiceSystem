# Invoice Management System

This is a simple Invoice Management System built with a layered architecture, focusing on separation of concerns. It includes four distinct projects: API, Service, Data, and Test. The API serves as the entry point, and it communicates with the Service project for business logic and with the Data project for database interactions.

## Project Structure

### `InvoiceManagementSystem.API`
- Contains the API controllers (e.g., `InvoicesController`) and configurations for the API.
- The controller communicates with the Service project to handle requests.
- Does not directly interact with the database to follow the separation of concerns principle.

### `InvoiceManagementSystem.Service`
- Contains business logic and service classes related to invoice calculations and other operations.
- Implements reusable helper methods for business operations.
- Abstracted and reusable as a class library.

### `InvoiceManagementSystem.Data`
- Contains the Entity Framework Core DbContext and repository classes to interact with the database.
- Uses SQL Server for persistence.
- All database-related operations are encapsulated in repository classes (e.g., `InvoiceRepository.cs`).

### `InvoiceManagementSystem.Test`
- Contains unit tests and test cases for the service methods, adhering to test-driven development principles.

## API Documentation

- The API will be available at: `https://localhost:5001` (or the port specified in your `launchSettings.json`).
- Swagger UI for API documentation and testing can be accessed at: `https://localhost:5001/swagger`.
